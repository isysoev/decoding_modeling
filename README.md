Modeling children's decoding skill using probabilistic programming

Discontinued code. Please avoid using.

If I remember correctly, alternating cuts does not perform that well, nor does it lead to intuitive pieces.

Alternating cuts refers to decoding a word by cutting away the largest prefix, then postfix, and so on, that exists in the pre-existing chunks set.

It was hoped that this would lead to more cuts and therefore better generalization of pieces, but if I remember correctly, it did not resolve issues with having ungeneralizable chunks.
