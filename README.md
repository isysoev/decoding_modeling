# decoding_modeling
Modeling children's decoding skill using probabilistic programming

For use in correlating probability-based difficulty scores between TOWRE and the phonix words.

This can be found in difficulty_analysis.ipynb.

The other files provide some counting functions for pg pairs, but if I remember correctly, difficulty_analysis should be able to use separate functions to run properly, without these files.
